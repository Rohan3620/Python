File handling is a fundamental concept in programming that allows developers to read from and write to files stored on a computer. In Python, file handling is accomplished using built-in functions such as open(), read(), write(), and close(). These functions enable programmers to manage data persistence, store user input, and process large datasets efficiently. Files can be opened in different modes, such as read ('r'), write ('w'), or append ('a'), depending on the required operation. Proper file handling ensures data integrity and prevents resource leaks by closing files after operations are complete. Mastering file handling is essential for robust software development.
